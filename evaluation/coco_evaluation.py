    Evaluate AR for object proposals, AP for instance detection/segmentation, AP
    for keypoint detection outputs using COCO's metrics.
    See http://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval and
    http://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-eval to understand its metrics.
    The metrics range from 0 to 100 (instead of 0 to 1), where a -1 or NaN means
    the metric cannot be computed (e.g. due to no predictions made).

    In addition to COCO, this evaluator is able to support any bounding box detection,
    instance segmentation, or keypoint detection dataset.
